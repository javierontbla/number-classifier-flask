# Number Classifier w/ React & Flask

This back-end, developed with Flask, complements a number classifier (0-9) system, with its front-end built on React.js. The integration of Flask allows for seamless utilization of scikit-learn, enabling the creation of a predictive model. Users can draw numbers on the screen, and the system accurately predicts what number it is.

### Where is the front-end?
